# Click C0-10DD1E-D PLC Security Assessment Report

### Component Focus
This assessment test focuses on controller memory.

### Purpose
This assessment test checks to verify if it is possible to manipulate the value of a ladder logic program variable stored in memory on the controller.

### Test Procedure
A single Click C0-10DD1E-D PLC was installed on a private local area network within the University of Nebraska at Omahaâ€™s Critical Infrastructure Lab via a Netgear 24-Port Hub.  The programming software for the controller, Click Programming Software V2.0, was installed on a VMware Fusion virtual machine running Windows 7 Professional.  Factory default network settings were replaced with an IP address of 192.168.0.101, a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, and gateway of 192.168.0.244 to match the requirements for the LAN.  A computer tower fan was wired into an output address on the controller.  The controller was then programmed with a simple ladder logic program in which a boolean variable stored in memory controlled whether the fan was turned on or off.  A Python script was written to send a packet to the controller using Modbus protocol to change the value of the variable controlling the fan.

### Test Results
While a custom protocol is used for communication between the programming software and the controller, the Click PLC will accept standard Modbus packets over TCP port 502.  Without a password, the controller accepted the forged Modbus packet to change the program boolean variable to a 1, and the fan turned on.  Changing the value for the variable to a 0 in the forged packet and sending it again to the controller turned the fan off.  Standard Modbus protocol that was developed by Modicon in the 1970s has no security measures built into it.  If a controller, receives a correctly formatted Modbus packet, the controller will execute the command it contains.  With a password set, the controller rejected the forged Modbus packets. It is important to note that the password protection on the controller is a separate mechanism from the Modbus protocol. However, if a legitimate user has recently entered the correct password in a current session, or an attacker knows and sends the password using the Koyo custom protocol first, the controller will then still accept Modbus packets to change variable values.  This occurs regardless of whether the Modbus packets come from the same IP address that the password did.
